# Configuration directory

Here's some configurations for my work environment. Sometimes I update configuration when needed, especially neovim. Some changes may be barely, also may be majority.

## List of configuration and explanation

* Zsh:
  - important configuration and without that dotfiles will be not normally worked, because in this configuration places some XDG environment paths.
  - for making workspace, firstly need in your .bashrc or .zshrc put code `source path/to/dotfiles/config/zsh/zshrc`

* Tmux:
  - here I use a oh-my-tmux repository
  - but I put some changes in tmux.conf.local for my comforts

* Oh-my-zsh:
  - terminal beautiful look with it
  - *important* if you want check repository of this plugin, you will need visit [page](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) because in my config already added other themes that breaking the list of commits

* yarn:
  - for neovim configuration, for some servers

* Neovim:
  - my main code editor that I use a lot of time
