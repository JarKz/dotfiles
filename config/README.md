# Configuration directory

Here's some configurations for my work environment. Sometimes I update configuration when needed, especially neovim. Some changes may be barely, also may be majority.

## List of configuration and explanation

* Zsh:
  - Important for Neovim and Tmux configuration, because some XDG environment variables used in 'dotfiles/zsh/zshrc';
  - Also I used custom aliases or configuations with omz (oh-my-zsh).

* Oh-my-zsh:
  - Custom themes, comfortable functions, aliases and plugins;
  - I have other theme that not included in the omz, he's placed in 'dotfiles/zsh/themes' directory.

* Tmux:
  - Default configuration is omt (oh-my-tmux);
  - I changed some properties in 'dotfiles/tmux/tmux.conf.local' for my environment: changing powerline, enabling vi mode in shell and etc.

* Neovim:
  - I use nightly version of nvim, so some settings my raise errors;
  - Before Neovim usage make sure that you done all need preparations!
