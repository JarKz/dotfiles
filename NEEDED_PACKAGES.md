# Needed packages to have working environment

- zsh
- gcc/g++
- neovim-nightly (because configuration works fine only on development version)
- tree-sitter (maybe also development version, uses for neovim-nightly)
- python (min version - 3.11) with pip
- unzip
- nodejs (for LSP in NeoVim)
- ruby (for htmlbeautifier, and other formatters for neovim)
- bat (for preview in the NeoVim's pligin fzf-lua)
- go (for fzf)
- fzf
- rg (better than grep, and used for neovim)
- tmux
